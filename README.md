# Copycat-Website

The Copycat Website Project requires students to reverse engineer a project an existing website from scratch. I choose to replicate a website called Pupilpath. This website is commonly used by students and teachers to record their grades. This project helped me practice the basic skills of web designing. Throughout the process, I learned how to research on my own. For example, I did not know how to remove the color of the link that was attached to the text. With a simple google search and videos, I learned how to change the color of the text to be inherited. This keyword causes the color of the text to color the value of its parent element. Therefore instead of the color of the link being purple, it is white. Basic skills like this are not only beneficial to coding but life in general.
